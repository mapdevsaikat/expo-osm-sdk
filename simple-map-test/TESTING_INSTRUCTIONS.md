# Testing Instructions for Expo OSM SDK

## 🗺️ **NEW: Multi-Point Navigation Feature Testing**

### Overview
The app now includes a comprehensive multi-point navigation system that allows users to:
- Create routes with multiple waypoints
- Navigate from user location to searched destinations  
- Build custom routes with start, waypoints, and destination points
- Step through navigation with visual feedback

### 🔍 **Testing the Multi-Point Navigation**

#### 1. **Search-Based Navigation**
1. **Open the app** and ensure location permissions are granted
2. **Use the search box** at the top to search for a location (e.g., "Mumbai", "Delhi", "Coffee shop")
3. **Tap a search result** - you'll see navigation options:
   - **"Add as Waypoint"** - Adds to your route as an intermediate stop
   - **"Add as Destination"** - Adds as the final destination
   - **"Navigate from My Location"** - Creates a route from your current location

#### 2. **Multi-Point Route Building**
1. **Swipe up** to open the bottom sheet controls
2. **Go to the "Navigation" tab** (✈️ Cities)
3. **Build a custom route**:
   - Search for multiple locations and add them as waypoints
   - Or use the "India Tour" quick demo button
   - Or tap any city and select "Add as Waypoint/Destination"

#### 3. **Navigation Controls**
1. **Start Navigation**: 
   - Add at least 2 waypoints
   - Tap "🚗 Start Navigation" 
   - The route will show all waypoints in order
2. **Navigate Through Waypoints**:
   - Use "➡️ Next" to move to the next waypoint
   - The map will animate to each location
   - Completed waypoints show with ✅ and strike-through
3. **Stop Navigation**: Use "🛑 Stop" to end the route

#### 4. **Demo Routes**
Test these pre-built routes:
- **"🇮🇳 India Tour"**: Multi-city route (Kolkata → Mumbai → Delhi)
- **"📍 Navigate to Kolkata from My Location"**: Uses your GPS location as start

### 🧪 **Feature Testing Checklist**

#### ✅ **Basic Functionality**
- [ ] Search box finds locations successfully
- [ ] Search results offer navigation options
- [ ] Waypoints are added to the route list
- [ ] Map shows markers for all waypoints
- [ ] City buttons offer waypoint options

#### ✅ **Navigation Flow**
- [ ] Can't start navigation with less than 2 waypoints
- [ ] Navigation status shows correctly (Active/Inactive)
- [ ] Current waypoint is highlighted during navigation  
- [ ] "Next" button advances through waypoints
- [ ] "Stop" button ends navigation properly
- [ ] Waypoint counter shows progress (e.g., "2/5")

#### ✅ **User Location Integration**
- [ ] "Navigate from My Location" gets GPS position
- [ ] GPS location is added as starting waypoint
- [ ] Location tracking works with navigation
- [ ] Error handling for GPS failures

#### ✅ **UI/UX Testing**
- [ ] Waypoint list shows route order clearly
- [ ] Remove buttons (✕) delete individual waypoints
- [ ] "Clear All Waypoints" removes everything
- [ ] Navigation controls are intuitive
- [ ] Visual feedback for visited waypoints

### 🚨 **Known Limitations**
- **Route Lines**: Currently using markers for visualization (actual route polylines will be added when OSRM hook export is fixed)
- **Distance/Duration**: Not yet calculated (pending OSRM integration)
- **Turn-by-turn**: This is a waypoint-to-waypoint navigation demo

### 📱 **Platform Testing**
Test on both platforms:
- **iOS**: All navigation features should work
- **Android**: All navigation features should work  
- **Web**: Search and waypoint management (routing may be limited)

### 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### Issue: "OSM view not available"
- **Solution**: Wait for map to fully load before using navigation features
- **Prevention**: App includes bulletproof error handling and retry logic

#### Issue: Search not finding results
- **Solution**: Check internet connection
- **Try**: Use simpler search terms like city names

#### Issue: Location permission errors
- **Solution**: Grant location permissions in device settings
- **Alternative**: Use city quick-add buttons instead of "My Location"

### 🔄 **Testing Flow Example**

1. **Launch app** → Wait for map to load
2. **Search "Mumbai"** → Tap result → Select "Add as Destination"  
3. **Search "Delhi"** → Tap result → Select "Add as Waypoint"
4. **Go to Navigation tab** → See route list with 2 waypoints
5. **Tap "Start Navigation"** → Navigation becomes active
6. **Use "Next" button** → Map flies to next waypoint
7. **Observe progress** → Waypoint marked as visited ✅
8. **Complete route** → All waypoints visited
9. **Tap "Stop"** → Navigation ends

This creates a comprehensive test of the entire multi-point navigation system!
