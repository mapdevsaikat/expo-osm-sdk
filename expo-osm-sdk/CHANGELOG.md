## [1.0.11] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Component Exports:** Fixed OSMView component export issue causing "Element type is invalid" error
  - Added named export for OSMView alongside default export
  - Created proper components/index.ts with correct export structure
  - Fixed MapContainer and Marker exports to match their actual export patterns
  - Resolves "got: undefined" component import errors

## [1.0.9] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Plugin Separation:** Separated plugin from main exports to prevent React Native import conflicts
  - Created separate `plugin.js` entry point that doesn't import React Native components
  - Plugin now accessible via `expo-osm-sdk/plugin` path
  - Fixes "Cannot use import statement outside a module" error during prebuild
  - Main package still exports components normally for app usage

## [1.0.8] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Package Exports:** Cleaned up package.json exports to remove obsolete plugin export paths
  - Removed incorrect "./plugin" export that pointed to non-existent paths
  - Simplified exports to only include main entry point
  - Fixes module resolution issues during prebuild

## [1.0.7] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Plugin Export Structure:** Fixed plugin export to properly support Expo's plugin system by using proper import/export syntax
  - Changed from `export { default } from './plugin/index'` to `import plugin from './plugin/index'; export default plugin`
  - Ensures plugin is correctly recognized when referenced by package name in app.json
  - Resolves "Package does not contain a valid config plugin" error

## [1.0.6] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Critical Plugin Fix:** Corrected the plugin export structure to use default export instead of named export, resolving the "Package does not contain a valid config plugin" error that prevented the SDK from working in apps.
- **Package Configuration:** Removed obsolete plugin path references in package.json that pointed to non-existent locations.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Web Crash:** Resolved an "Uncaught Error" on web by providing a proper fallback component for `OSMView`, preventing app crashes in web environments.
- **Packaging:** Corrected the `files` array in `package.json` to exclude source (`.ts`/`.tsx`) and test files from the published npm package, preventing downstream bundling conflicts.
- **Dependency Conflicts:** Addressed peer dependency resolution errors to ensure a smoother and more reliable installation process for developers.

### Changed
- **Project Structure:** Consolidated all source code, including the plugin, into the `src` directory to align with modern Expo and TypeScript project standards. This simplifies the build process and improves module resolution.
