## [1.0.7] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Plugin Export Structure:** Fixed plugin export to properly support Expo's plugin system by using proper import/export syntax
  - Changed from `export { default } from './plugin/index'` to `import plugin from './plugin/index'; export default plugin`
  - Ensures plugin is correctly recognized when referenced by package name in app.json
  - Resolves "Package does not contain a valid config plugin" error

## [1.0.6] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Critical Plugin Fix:** Corrected the plugin export structure to use default export instead of named export, resolving the "Package does not contain a valid config plugin" error that prevented the SDK from working in apps.
- **Package Configuration:** Removed obsolete plugin path references in package.json that pointed to non-existent locations.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Web Crash:** Resolved an "Uncaught Error" on web by providing a proper fallback component for `OSMView`, preventing app crashes in web environments.
- **Packaging:** Corrected the `files` array in `package.json` to exclude source (`.ts`/`.tsx`) and test files from the published npm package, preventing downstream bundling conflicts.
- **Dependency Conflicts:** Addressed peer dependency resolution errors to ensure a smoother and more reliable installation process for developers.

### Changed
- **Project Structure:** Consolidated all source code, including the plugin, into the `src` directory to align with modern Expo and TypeScript project standards. This simplifies the build process and improves module resolution.
